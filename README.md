# FoodBell

### This is a project submitted for ECE-651 course at UWaterloo.
#### The Objective is to create a unified solution ‘Food Bell’ - a web application that provides an interface for facilitating subscription-based meal services by connecting customers to the right vendors.
#### This system will save the major effort involved in exploring meal and vendor options for the customers.
#### With the help of this system, vendors would have a hassle-free experience in managing and tracking all their orders.
#### This solution aims at fulfilling the demand and supply gap for home cooked food.
